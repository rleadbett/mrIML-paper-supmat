<p>This case study demonstrates <em>MrIML 2.0</em> on a larger dataset with multiple taxonomic groups across a forest successional gradient. We analyze 144 plots established across forest age categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mature forest</strong>: Unharvested with no fire disturbance for â‰¥60 years</li>
<li><strong>~45 years post-harvest</strong></li>
<li><strong>~27 years post-harvest</strong></li>
<li><strong>~7 years post-harvest</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>At each plot, we recorded ground-active beetles, plants, and birds, along with environmental covariates including coarse wood debris, leaf litter depth, and soil variables (pH, conductivity).</p>
